# 🚀 RAM Sentinel // Roadmap & Future Architecture

We are building the ultimate privacy-first system optimizer. Here is the vision for v2.0 and beyond.

## 🧠 Phase 1: Intelligent Automation (The "Neural" Upgrade)
*Currently, we use static thresholds (e.g., "close tab after 30 mins"). We want true intelligence.*

### 1. **Predictive Pre-Caching**
   - **Concept**: The system learns your daily routine.
   - **Use Case**: If you always open Visual Studio Code at 9:00 AM, RAM Sentinel clears 2GB of RAM at 8:59 AM to ensure instant launch times.
   - **Tech**: Local-only SQLite database training a lightweight TensorFlow Lite model.

### 2. **Context-Aware Tab Suspension**
   - **Concept**: Don't just close tabs based on time; understand *context*.
   - **Use Case**: Never close a tab that is playing music, compiling code, or has an unsaved form filled out.
   - **Tech**: DOM analysis of the page before purging.

## 🎮 Phase 2: "Game Mode" & Power User Tools
*Expand beyond RAM into total system control.*

### 3. **Hyper-V Game Mode**
   - **Concept**: One-click "War Room" button.
   - **Action**: Instantly pauses 30+ background Windows services (Printer Spooler, Windows Update, Search Indexer) to dedicate 100% of CPU/RAM to your game.
   - **Safety**: Automatically restarts them when you exit Game Mode.

### 4. **Network Sentinel (Firewall)**
   - **Concept**: "Little Snitch" for Windows.
   - **Feature**: Real-time visualization of which apps are "phoning home." Block them with one click.
   - **Privacy**: Fits perfectly with our "Offline-First" philosophy.

## 🔐 Phase 3: Advanced Security (The "Vault" Evolved)

### 5. **Steganographic Vaults**
   - **Concept**: Hide your Ghost Drive *inside* a harmless looking file.
   - **Use Case**: To an outsider, it looks like a 4GB `vacation_movie.mp4` (and it plays!). But mount it with RAM Sentinel, and it's a secure drive.
   - **Tech**: AES-256 encryption with offset byte injection.

### 6. **Dead Man's Switch**
   - **Concept**: Ultimate data protection.
   - **Feature**: If you don't enter a password every X days (or if a specific USB key isn't plugged in), the Vault destroys itself securely.

---

## ☁️ Phase 4: Decentralized Sync (Optional)

### 7. **P2P Encrypted Sync**
   - **Concept**: Sync your "Read Later" tabs between your Laptop and Desktop *without* a cloud server.
   - **Tech**: WebRTC / Local LAN Sync (like Syncthing).
   - **Privacy**: Data transfers directly device-to-device. No middleman.

---

## 🎨 Phase 5: UI/UX Evolution

### 8. **Custom "Skins" & Themes**
   - **Concept**: Allow users to share CSS themes for the dashboard.
   - **Ideas**: "Retro 95", "Terminal Green", "Anime Aesthetics".

### 9. **Mobile Companion App**
   - **Concept**: View your PC's stats on your phone over local Wi-Fi.
   - **Feature**: Act as a remote "Panic Button" trigger.
